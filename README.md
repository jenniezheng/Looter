# Looter

### About 
This application is, as of January 2017, the largest project I've built yet. I created the project around December 2016, and since then, I've focused less on Unity and more on web development and machine learning. I'm sad to leave Unity behind, but I wish to create impactful projects, and I think that's easier with the new fields I'm getting into.
